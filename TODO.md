# TODO

Lightweight kanban maintained by Claude Code. Read at the start of every
session; update before finishing (move cards, add new ones, trim Done).

## Now

- Team name normalizer gaps: Bielefeld, Greuther Fürth, Holstein Kiel,
  Ajaccio unmapped (flagged during backfill).

## Next

- In-Play Jumps page is still WC-only (hardcoded `league:
  'soccer_fifa_world_cup'` fetch + static "World Cup" label,
  InPlayJumpsPage.tsx) — was built WC-only from inception, no fallback
  data path for other leagues. Left untouched during the WC revert
  since generalizing it is a real feature-scope decision, not a
  one-line change. Decide: generalize to all leagues, or leave as a
  WC '26-only historical/beta page.

## Later

- Re-fit rho/drawInflation in xG mode once 2026/27 accumulates enough
  matches (fallback fit was rejected — see fit-v1.md).
- CL/UEL restoration: needs Elo-based cross-league strengths +
  competition-specific constants. Blocked until then.
- qualityWeight/spDiscount: fit or delete once shots/SP historical
  data exists (currently unfittable).

## Done

(newest first)

- World Cup over: reverted every WC-tournament-window default back to
  normal (DEFAULT_LEAGUE redirect hack removed from Home/SteamResults/
  Drifters, CL/UEL/UECL unhidden + WC hidden in LEAGUE_CONFIG, featured
  gold WC pill removed from nav, LiveTicker generalized back to all
  leagues). Deleted WorldCupHubPage + components/wc/. Verified live in
  prod — clean "/" with no redirect, Top 5 + UCL/UCLQ/UEL/UECL in the
  picker, no "World Cup" text anywhere, zero console errors — `0da9253`
- Local/UTC kickoff-time toggle: fixed a real bug along the way — every
  page parsed the backend's marker-less UTC timestamp strings as browser
  LOCAL time (wrong by the viewer's UTC offset for anyone outside the
  UK), including countdown timers. New frontend/src/utils/time.ts is the
  single parse/format/day-grouping choke point every page now goes
  through; TimePreferenceContext persists the choice. Verified against
  live prod data — every time shifts by exactly the UTC offset when
  toggled, zero console errors. Mobile-menu toggle placement verified by
  code review only (matches the working desktop toggle + existing
  Account section pattern) — automated click-through testing was
  blocked by a browser-automation tooling issue in this session (even
  an unrelated pre-existing button didn't respond to simulated clicks);
  worth a quick manual phone check next time the site's touched — `5f3c647`
- Fixed NameError in syndicate_alerter totals check (opening_line ->
  line) + isolated per-match failures so one bad match can't blank
  Telegram/tweet checking for the whole cycle — found during the France
  v Spain steam-alert post-mortem — `e6a1319`
- Live league constants job: avgGoalsPerTeam/homeAwayRatio computed
  weekly from historical_matches (weighted 4-season rolling window),
  league_constants + league_constants_history tables, weekly scheduler
  job (Mon 10:00 UTC) + admin trigger, GET /league-constants, predictor
  fetches on load with hardcoded fallback (all 5 leagues verified live
  in prod, zero console errors) — `2449bd5`
- Steps 2-3 diagnosis + fallback-only H2+H5 correction — xG (production)
  pipeline exonerated, no production change; backtest-only correction
  applied to SECONDARY run — `0f4bb1a`
- xg_data season migration — `2b6d6a5`
- calibration harness + baseline — `cca2810`
- fit-v1 (rejected, gates held) — `ee9835e`
- input form cull — `7c871ea`
- AH/Totals/BTTS/CS markets — `b902e63`
- home advantage symmetric split — `d4b0d48`
- CL/UEL hidden — `b902e63`
- report-hygiene rule — `b902e63`
