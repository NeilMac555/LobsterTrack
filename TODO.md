# TODO

Lightweight kanban maintained by Claude Code. Read at the start of every
session; update before finishing (move cards, add new ones, trim Done).

## Now

- Team name normalizer gaps: Bielefeld, Greuther Fürth, Holstein Kiel,
  Ajaccio unmapped (flagged during backfill).

## Next

## Later

- Re-fit rho/drawInflation in xG mode once 2026/27 accumulates enough
  matches (fallback fit was rejected — see fit-v1.md).
- CL/UEL restoration: needs Elo-based cross-league strengths +
  competition-specific constants. Blocked until then.
- qualityWeight/spDiscount: fit or delete once shots/SP historical
  data exists (currently unfittable).

## Done

(newest first)

- Live league constants job: avgGoalsPerTeam/homeAwayRatio computed
  weekly from historical_matches (weighted 4-season rolling window),
  league_constants + league_constants_history tables, weekly scheduler
  job (Mon 10:00 UTC) + admin trigger, GET /league-constants, predictor
  fetches on load with hardcoded fallback (all 5 leagues verified live
  in prod, zero console errors) — `2449bd5`
- Steps 2-3 diagnosis + fallback-only H2+H5 correction — xG (production)
  pipeline exonerated, no production change; backtest-only correction
  applied to SECONDARY run — `0f4bb1a`
- xg_data season migration — `2b6d6a5`
- calibration harness + baseline — `cca2810`
- fit-v1 (rejected, gates held) — `ee9835e`
- input form cull — `7c871ea`
- AH/Totals/BTTS/CS markets — `b902e63`
- home advantage symmetric split — `d4b0d48`
- CL/UEL hidden — `b902e63`
- report-hygiene rule — `b902e63`
